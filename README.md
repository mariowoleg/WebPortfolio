Welcome to my personal web portfolio!

This project aims to showcase part of my skills in frontend development and demonstrate my ability to build modern and user-friendly web applications using Angular.

To visualize it correctly, it is recommended to use Chrome. Here is the URL: https://webportfolio-c979a.web.app
