# WebPortfolio with Angular and Firebase🌐
Welcome to my personal web portfolio!

This project aims to showcase part of my skills in frontend development and demonstrate my ability to build modern and user-friendly web applications using Angular.

To visualize correctly, it is recommended to use Chrome. Here is the URL: https://webportfolio-c979a.web.app

## 🛠️ Technologies
· Angular CLI v18.2.11
· Firebase Hosting
· CSS

## How to Run the Project Locall
1.Clone the repositor:
Use "git clone" to clone the project repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/webportfolio.git

    ```
2.Install dependencies:
Make sure you have Node.js installed. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
